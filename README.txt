Step 0 bootstraps the Makefile and test skeleton. I'm testing each of these commits
via manual verification and/or compiler/linker errors.

Commits may mention 'Red' and 'Green'. Red refers to creating a failing test or
new compiler/linker error. 'Green' refers to implementing the product change
that makes the test pass or clears the error.
